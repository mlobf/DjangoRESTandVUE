  My Notes

  To add a extra field using serializer.ModelSerializer is too simple.
    there no need to make a migrations or change te table field.
  All process can be done as easy as imported just below the Class Declaration.
  This was done on time_since_publication_field
    Which was imported end,  after that, was created a method.
